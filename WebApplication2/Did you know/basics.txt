If condition returns true then the statements inside the body of “if” are executed and the statements inside body of “else” are skipped.If condition returns false then the statements inside the body of “if” are skipped and the statements in “else” are executed.
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each switch case.
A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.
A while loop in C programming repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task. To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value.
A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
