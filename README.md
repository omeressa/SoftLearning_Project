# SoftLearning_Project

this is a web application project, for teaching a novice programming languages principles by using GAMES.

the web contains  sum of 10 games each game got up to 10 levels

each player creats an acount then sign in it to play the games.

we added a point system to keep track of the players advancement, each time a player finishs a level he get some points

we appointed ranks: novice , advanced , expert. the more points player get the more ranks he get and by getting more points you will get the chance to play other games which at 
first will be locked.

first time players will be tested with quizes to addapte there rank.( we used the principle of adaptive learning to do so ).
